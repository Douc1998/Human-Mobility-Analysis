A packages for analyzing travel features through trajectory data, including 1-order to K-order spatial features (e.g., Number of stay point, radius of gyration, entropy of stay points, travel entropy, Motif ratio, etc.), temporal features (e.g., travel rhythm), spatiotemporal features(eg., ration of k-radius of gyration, unicity, etc.), and semantic features (unban functionality of locations).
